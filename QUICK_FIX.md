# Quick Fix for "Problem X"

## The database was already cleared! ✅

You ran `clearUsers.js` successfully earlier and it deleted 2 users.

## The ONLY thing you need to do now:

### **RESTART YOUR BACKEND SERVER**

1. **Stop your current backend server**
   - Find the terminal/command prompt running your server
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it

2. **Start it again**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   OR if you're running from root:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **That's it!** Now try to register again.

## Why this fixes it:

- Database: ✅ Already cleared (0 users)
- Server: ❌ Still has cached data from old users
- Solution: Restart server to clear cache

## If you get SSL errors with the scripts:

**Don't worry!** The database is already empty. Just restart your server and test.

## Test Steps After Restarting Server:

1. Go to your app
2. Register with: `dhruveloper2005@gmail.com`
3. Should work now! ✅

## If it still says "email exists":

1. Clear browser localStorage:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Click "Clear storage" → "Clear site data"

2. Refresh page

3. Try registering again
