# Theme Customization Feature

## Overview
The Dear Diary Expense Tracker now includes a comprehensive theme customization system that allows users to personalize their experience with custom backgrounds and color themes.

## Features

### 1. Custom Background Wallpaper

## Technical Details

### Components Created
- **ThemeContext.tsx**: Context provider for theme state management
- **ThemeCustomizer.tsx**: Main customizer UI component
- **CustomBackground.tsx**: Component that renders custom background images

### Storage
- Background images are stored as base64 data URLs in localStorage
- Theme preset selection is stored as a string
- Custom color configurations (if implemented) are stored as JSON

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image compression**: Large images are automatically resized to max 1920px and compressed to 85% quality
- **Hardware acceleration**: Uses CSS `transform: translateZ(0)` and `will-change` for GPU rendering
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: CSS variable updates are batched using requestAnimationFrame
- **Smooth transitions**: All color changes use optimized cubic-bezier timing (0.3s)
- **Backdrop filter optimization**: Uses both `-webkit-backdrop-filter` and `backdrop-filter` for cross-browser support
- **Lazy loading**: Background component only renders when an image is set
- **Translucent overlay**: Gradient overlay (85-88% opacity) with 3px blur maintains elegance without performance hit

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires localStorage support
- Requires FileReader API for image uploads

## Future Enhancements
Potential features for future versions:
- Custom color picker for individual colors
- Multiple background image support with slideshow
- Texture and pattern overlays
- Import/export theme configurations
- Community theme sharing
